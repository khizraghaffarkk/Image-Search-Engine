I have developed a small application using Unsplash API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This API will help the user to fetch the images from Unsplash site. Users can add any category of image and get the available images on the webpage. Moreover, users can load more images by clicking on the "show more" button. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
